#Abstract—— A unique approach to read water meters using the
smart automated metering technique, for the information of water
consumption from the field directly to the owner using IoT
methods. The apt water metering approach is different from
conventional methodologies as the apt water meter will be costeffective and user-friendly. This smart water meter measures daily
water consumption and provides live data on our smartphone
which is connected to a database. Also, monitoring of daily
consumption helps to cut off wastage of water which leads to the
key component of the water management system. These data can be
accessed online from any provided region. This proposed scheme
can save time by eliminating the manual meter reading and enable
a flexible billing cycle in metropolitan cities.
