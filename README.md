# Automated-water-metering-system

## **Abstract**
A unique approach to read water meters using the
smart automated metering technique, for the information of water
consumption from the field directly to the owner using IoT
methods. The apt water metering approach is different from
conventional methodologies as the apt water meter will be costeffective and user-friendly. This smart water meter measures daily
water consumption and provides live data on our smartphone
which is connected to a database. Also, monitoring of daily
consumption helps to cut off wastage of water which leads to the
key component of the water management system. These data can be
accessed online from any provided region. This proposed scheme
can save time by eliminating the manual meter reading and enable
a flexible billing cycle in metropolitan cities.

## Benefits of apt water meter:

1. Ensure a safe and steady water supply.
2. Enable flexible billing cycle Fight Non-Revenue Water
with data monitoring.
3. By using a feedback mechanism with the help of smart
water meter sensors the metering system becomes more
reliable.
4. Save money by saving on unnecessary water
distribution.
5. Eliminate the need for manual meter readings. Control
Water Supply Remotely with IoT Valves with the help
of communication sensors, we can track data on our
phones by using an app and a database.
6. For live monitoring, LCD is used which displays the
flow rate and usage continuously. Get a Bird-eye view
of Water Consumption.
7. The efficiency of smart meters does not depreciate with
time.
## Methodology:
In this project, we proposed the solution for water utilization using
a water flow sensor and interface with Node MCU
microcontroller which is embedded with Arduino code. Arduino
software is used for Arduino coding to find the flow rate of
water, volume consumption displays the output in LCD, and
send the sensed data to the Things Speak server which can be
monitored by customers.
# Hardware needed:
**1. Node MCU microcontroller**:

Node MCU has 10-bit ADC which means it scales an
analog signal in a range of 0-1023. It has an inbuilt serial
monitor that allows taking serial input and output from the
Node MCU, while Node MCU is in action. It has inbuilt WiFi. So that we can easily send sensed data through the Wi-Fi
module. Node MCU is cost-effective.

**2. Water Flow Sensor**:
A water flow sensor is used to take a note of how much
water has been transferred from one area to the other. It
consists of a plastic valve body, a water rotor, and a Hall
Effect sensor.

**3. LCD 16*2 DISPLAY:**:
16x2 LCD means it can display 16 characters per line
and there are 2 such lines. In this LCD each character is
displayed in a 5x7 pixel matrix. The LCD 16Ã—2
working principle is, it blocks the light rather than
dissipate.

## Setting up the webserver: 

The Things Speak server was used in this project to
display the amount of water consumed and the flow rate of
water. Things Speak provides instant visualizations of data sent
from the hardware (Node MCU). The data stored in the Thing
speak Database can be retrieved as an excel sheet or using HTTP
calls and the REST API and MQTT protocols via LAN or over
the internet. It is convenient as the data stored is analyzed, and
aggregated, and visualized through graphs

## CONCLUSION.

An apt water meter based on IoT and a database for keeping
track of the flow of water is discussed. The benefits of the
prototype system are discussed. The novel approach overcomes
disadvantages in conventional water-meter systems such as
tampering in pre-paid water-meters that often go undetected due
to the standalone nature of pre-paid meters; and many other
drawbacks as discussed. The proposed architecture also helps in
the economy by decreasing labor work.
The apt water meter is more reliable and feasible than the
conventional water meter since the apt water meter eradicates
water issues faced by both government and the customers.
